# Peter's Portfolio Website

Woah, you found this page!

Surprise surprise, welcome to my portfolio website.

I made this `gem` in 3 days!

If you want to see the website, it's located here: https://peterzhang.vercel.app/

## Here's the tech stack

I used some relatively simple technologies:
- Vite-React (cuz it's faster than react)
- TailwindCSS (it's pretty cool once you get the hang of it)
- ThreeJS (the best)
- Blender (to create models)
- Vercel (to build + publish - because I'm broke and don't want to spend money on a domain just yet)
